            <mat-card-content>
                <p>The Secure Data Commons (SDC) platform provides a data lake of various transportation related
                    datasets. The datasets consists of structured, semi-structured or unstructured data and are stored
                    in raw, curated and published formats. Each dataset has different data agreements based on the
                    complexity and sensitivity of the data and is available for SDC users on a need-and-case basis upon
                    appropriate approvals.</p>

                    <h4>Dataset Formats</h4>
                    <ul><p class="pull-margin-40">The dataset formats are described as follows:</p>

                        <li>Raw datasets</li>
                        <p>The data stored in its native or original format are referred to as Raw datasets. These
                            datasets could be in structured (databases, logs, financial data etc), semi-structured
                            (HTML, XML, RDF, CSV) and un-structured (images, PDF, docs). This data is unaltered and
                            stored in as-is format. The data can be received through continuous streaming sources (APIs,
                            sensors) or one-time load from external sources</p>
                        <li>Curated datasets</li>
                        <p>Data curation is a process of integrating the raw data collected from various sources,
                            annotating the data and presenting it in such a way that the value of the data is maintained
                            overtime and the data remains available for reuse and preservation. Curated datasets enable
                            data discovery and retrieval, maintain quality, add value and provide for re-use over time,
                            for researchers and data scientists. The curation process includes data transformations from
                            unstructured and semi structured formats to a structured format, deduplication of data, data
                            obfuscation, data cleansing etc thus providing high quality of data for researchers to
                            create meaningful insights</p>
                        <li>Published datasets</li>
                        <p>Published datasets are created by researchers to disclose their research for other users to
                            verify and reuse them beyond the original purpose for which they were collected. Published
                            datasets are a result of combining analysis on curated datasets available in SDC platform
                            along with other datasets or algorithms that is owned/created by a researcher or data
                            scientist</p>
