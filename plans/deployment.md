# Deployment Plan

[v2.17.0](https://github.com/USDOT-SDC/sdc-dot-webportal/tree/2.17.0)


### Pre-Deployment - General Tasks:
1. Merge open PR into master.
2. Reset the 2.17.0 tag in the remote repo, deleting from (development) branch and adding to main.
3. On  PROD webportal, ensure a minimum of 5 files are available for data export so theyâ€™re available for export as part of post-release testing.
4. Grab screenshots of pre-deploy FAQ content.


### Pre-Deployment - Ready the Build Environment:
1. Verify/Install the Deployment Build Environment:
   1. Windows or Linux
   2. AWS CLI [version 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
   3. Node.js  [14.20.1](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v14.20.1/)
      1. If installation is required, check the box to install the necessary tools, at the Tools for Native Modules step.
   4. npm [8.19.2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm) (included with NodeJS/Chocolatey installation)
   5. Python [3.9.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-399/) (included with NodeJS/Chocolatey installation)
   6. Angular CLI [6.0.8](https://angular.io/cli)  /  Angular 5.2.1 (npm install)
   7. For additional information on needed installs and dependencies, refer to [README.md](https://github.com/USDOT-SDC/sdc-dot-webportal#installation-steps-for-ui-first-time-build--).
   
   
2. Make a backup of the current webportal files
   1. Within build machine, create a 'backup-<currentdate>' directory and run the following:
     `aws s3 cp s3://prod-webportal-hosting-004118380849  backup-<currentdate>/  --recursive`
   
      
### Deployment Plan for v2.16.0:
1. On the deployment machine, pull/clone the sdc-do-webportal repo at tag 2.17.0


2. Navigate to the webportal\webapp folder, within the repo directory, and run `ecs_prod_deploy.sh`.
   - Builds the webportal files (the dist folder)
   - Moves the files into the webportal hosting s3 bucket
   - Calls the AWS Systems Manager document, prod-nginx-asset-update, which moves the files onto the prod-nginx-web-proxy servers.


3. Verify the web portal s3 bucket now lists data from the previous date of deployment.
