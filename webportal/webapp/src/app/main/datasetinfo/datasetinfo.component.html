      <h3>Datasets</h3>
      <mat-card-content>
        <p>
          The Secure Data Commons (SDC) platform provides a data lake of various
          transportation related datasets. The datasets consists of structured,
          semi-structured or unstructured data and are stored in raw, curated
          and published formats. Each dataset has different data agreements
          based on the complexity and sensitivity of the data and is available
          for SDC users on a need-and-case basis upon appropriate approvals.
        </p>

          <h4>Dataset Formats</h4>
          <ul>
            <p class="pull-margin-40">
              The dataset formats are described as follows:
            </p>

            <li>Raw datasets</li>
            <p>
              The data stored in its native or original format are referred to
              as Raw datasets. These datasets could be in structured (databases,
              logs, financial data etc), semi-structured (HTML, XML, RDF, CSV)
              and un-structured (images, PDF, docs). This data is unaltered and
              stored in as-is format. The data can be received through
              continuous streaming sources (APIs, sensors) or one-time load from
              external sources
            </p>
            <li>Curated datasets</li>
            <p>
              Data curation is a process of integrating the raw data collected
              from various sources, annotating the data and presenting it in
              such a way that the value of the data is maintained overtime and
              the data remains available for reuse and preservation. Curated
              datasets enable data discovery and retrieval, maintain quality,
              add value and provide for re-use over time, for researchers and
              data scientists. The curation process includes data
              transformations from unstructured and semi structured formats to a
              structured format, deduplication of data, data obfuscation, data
              cleansing etc thus providing high quality of data for researchers
              to create meaningful insights
            </p>
            <li>Published datasets</li>
            <p>
              Published datasets are created by researchers to disclose their
              research for other users to verify and reuse them beyond the
              original purpose for which they were collected. Published datasets
              are a result of combining analysis on curated datasets available
              in SDC platform along with other datasets or algorithms that is
              owned/created by a researcher or data scientist

                  The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) developed the
                  Highway Safety Information System (HSIS) to support safety
                  research programs and provides input for program policy
                  decisions. HSIS is a roadway-based system that provides
                  quality data on a large number of crash, roadway, and traffic
                  variables. The crash, roadway inventory, and traffic volume
                  data are acquired annually from a select group of States.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>FHWA provides</b> this data to researchers upon request
                  through the HSIS webpage. Educators who wish to use HSIS data
                  for instructional purposes in a road safety course should
                  contact HSIS staff directly at Ana.Eigen@dot.gov. For more
